\maketitle
This note extends Theorem 1 of \cite{tsitsiklis1994asynchronous}. First, we go through the proof of a simplified version of Theorem 1 in \cite{tsitsiklis1994asynchronous}. In particular, we don't include asynchronous algorithm part. We present a comparison of the setup and proof the main theorem, i.e., theorem 1 and 3 in \cite{tsitsiklis1994asynchronous}. Moreover, we provide an explicit proof of lemma 1 in \cite{tsitsiklis1994asynchronous} using Robbins-Siegmund Theorem by \cite{robbins1971convergence}\\
\\
Then we go through the proof of theorem 1 in \cite{jaakkola1993convergence} which is similar.\\
\\
Last, we extend these theorems.
