\section{Compactness and Finite Dimension}

\begin{frame}{Definition}

\begin{definition}
    A metric space $X$ is said to be \textbf{sequentially compact} if every sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence. A subset $M$ of $X$ is said to be compact if $M$ is compact considered as a subspace of $X$, that is, if every sequence in $M$ has a convergent subsequence whose limit is an element of $M$.
